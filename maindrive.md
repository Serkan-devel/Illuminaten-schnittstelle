## Minds/Lupina

The MindsAPI is used for any type of program (like a browser an app or a bot) to interact with the 'Minds' social network.
However, Minds INC doesn't provide any documentation for the API since three years the social site has officially launched.
This makes it harder for 3rd-party developers to develop apps for this site, making it also less accessible to its users aswell.

## TODO: API <> layout

While documenting this platform, I have noticed, that this site leaks all user data at many requests to the API.
All user settings, preferences, gender and date of birth (if set) are all exposed for everyone to view.
